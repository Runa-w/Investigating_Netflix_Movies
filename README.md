# Investigating_Netflix_Movies
# A data analysis project investigating Netflix movies from the 1990's to determine the most frequent duration.
# To complete this project, I imported a CSV file containing Netflix movie data. I then used NumPy and Pandas to filter the data to show only action movies from the 1990s.
# I then used matplotlib to illustrate that the most common Netflix action movie duration in the 1990s was approximately 94 minutes. 
# For a final investigation, I showed that of the 1990s Netflix action movies, only 7 were considered to be short movies (having a duration of 90 minutes or less).
